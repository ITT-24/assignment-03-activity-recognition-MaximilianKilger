## How to use:

### Data Gathering: 
Before recording data, make sure the PORT, ACTIVITY and LOG_NUMBER in the script is set correctly. Run gather-data.py. Press SPACE to start the recording. Perform the action you want to record. Press SPACE again to stop the recording. If you are satisfied with the recording, press S to save the data; or press SPACE to start a new recording. Press Q to quit.

### Fitness Trainer:
Make sure the PORT in the script matches the one configured with your sensor. Run fitness-trainer.py. Wait a few seconds while the model is loaded and the first samples of sensor data are analyzed. The trainer will then display the predicted activity. The predicted activity may differ from the action performed.
